This project entails the development of a robust terminal-based billing system tailored to meet the operational needs of A-to-Z Supermarket. One of its key features is the provision for both user and administrator logins, with users accessing the system via their mobile numbers and administrators through their designated email IDs. By implementing this dual login system, the project ensures secure access control and distinct privileges for different user roles.

An integral aspect of the system is its utilization of CSV files for efficient data storage and retrieval. This choice of file format enables seamless management of essential information such as product details, transaction records, and user credentials. Leveraging CSV files not only streamlines data handling processes but also enhances the scalability and maintainability of the billing system.

Through the development and implementation of this project, I have honed my skills in file handling, data management, and system architecture using the C++ programming language. This hands-on experience has deepened my understanding of core concepts such as linked lists and data structures, while also providing valuable insights into software engineering principles and best practices.
